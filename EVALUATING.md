# EVALUATING

To evaluate the performance of parallel parsers generated by GoPAPAGENO, we have chosen JSON as a representative language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GoPAPAGENO is a tool to generate parallel parsers starting from user-provided lexicon and grammar specifications.
> It shouldn't be compared directly with production-grade specialized JSON parsers.

The benchmarks were executed on three diverse files, each approximately 180MB in size, which contain different amounts of parallel sequences and deeply nested structures. These files are the same ones used to test Associative Operator Precedence Parsing in the work that first introduced it:
- **Emojis**: the entire input is made of a single, non-nested JSON object with many key-value pairs of string type, each representing the URL to a particular emoji. This file should exhibit the maximum possible amount of parallelism.
- **Citylots**: a dataset which shows a fair amount of parallelism, as a large portion of it is made of long arrays. The elements of those arrays, however, are complex objects and not simple terminal strings.
- **Wikidata**: the input file is a single array made up of many objects with a complex structure and shorter parallel sequences. This is the file that exhibits the least amount of parallelism.

> [!NOTE]
> GoPAPAGENO allows users to set two parameters, the average token length `avg` and the parallelism factor `pf`, before running a generated parser. 
> These parameters are specific to the input file, and different values could potentially lead to very different results. 
> For these benchmarks, the following values have been decided:
> - Emojis: `avg = 8, pf = 1`
> - Citylots: `avg = 4, pf = 0.5`
> - Emojis: `avg = 4, pf = 0`
