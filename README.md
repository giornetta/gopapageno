GoPAPAGENO
========

GoPAPAGENO *(Go PArallel PArser GENeratOr)* is a parallel parser generator based on **Floyd's Operator Precedence Grammars**.

The program can generate parallel Go parsers starting from two specification files, which resemble those used by Flex and Bison, although with some differences.

GoPAPAGENO is able to either generate type stubs to be integrated in a Go project, or completely self-contained programs that can be used without further effort.
